# takehome-test-ngp

In this repo, I provided two solutions, one utilizing as a script and one that utilizes a server to enable testing.
To use the script, simply run 

### node script.js
------------------------------------
To run the server or execute the test for it, run this first :

### npm install

After that, you may run the command:

### npm run test

This will prompt test results and descriptions for each test.

------------------------------------

To use the server, run :

### node server.js

After running the command, you may go to :
localhost:4000/api

The request will simply show the data in the browser from the get request that used the NGP 7 API.
But if you check the console where you ran the command, you will see 
console logs that will output what's expected
